# SPA - REST API - MYSQL DB

## Trying to implement the project I've worked on an year ago during my period at Apex Software Solutions.

### This is a Single Page Application, where the header and left panel will remain constant, while the right panel will me modified according to the input given by the user. This Works on continuous AJAX requests, pulling the data from the server. ###

#### To Do: 
  1. Connect to a REST API which is inturn connected to Database. 
  2. Front-end design developments.
